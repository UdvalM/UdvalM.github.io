# Welcome to my web design and development page

This is my second year learning about computers, I know python and currently learning c++ right now. I took web design and development because my computer programming class did html for a month or two and I loved it. However I was having issues with putting pictures onto my page, and by taking this class now I am hoping to get a little more advanced with my pages. 

## About me 

My name is Udval and I go by she/her. I am a highschool senior at Wakefield HighSchool. I moved to the U.S four years ago,  

### Major

I am currently undecided my major and what I'm interested it because I have very colliding interests. I love social/criminal justice but I also love mechatronics engineering, I am considering majoring in criminology at georgmason as my undergraduate degree for law school, or I could just go for my mechatronics enineering and if it sticks I would pursue. The reason I'm trying to decide early on because I want to be efficient with my time and have, suppose more experience early on if that makes sense. 

### Music

I love music so much, I have been playing musical instruments since elementary school. I love learning about different genres of musis and discovering them. My favorite genres include, vkei, numetal and perhaps little metal here and there. I have played morin khuur for like 10 years now, which mean I started when I was in 2nd grade. One of my newer instrument is guitar, but its been almost two years since I started learning it. I struggle with practicing regularly since I am very caught up with school work most of the time.
