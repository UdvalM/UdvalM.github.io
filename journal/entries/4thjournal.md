- I looked at cvs to see how they constructed their about me and overall schedule information, they had it as a little button on the top, but since my business was a music store I figured that I should just have it as a listed column. I visited guitar center to see the overall theme and color scheme for a music store website. They had consistent red and yellow scheme, and since ciel is sky in french, i made my texts in gray/black and the pictures blue. I saw their little announcement blogs as well, and I thought it would be cool for me to add ones as well. 

- At first it was complicated and annoying to navigate through, but once I got the general gist, it was fun in a way, it was fun seeing the little pictures and symbols I add in matter of seconds. With html I had to wait a little bit and do git commands to see if my code worked at all, so it is convenient in that sense as well.
