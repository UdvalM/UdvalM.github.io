    <h1>How to make a cake for your arch nemesis(no)</h1>
    <a href="#instructions">Jump to the tutorial</a>
    <p>During my junior year, I was at my lowest. And as I was searching for a way to relax myself, I picked up on bakery. And during my first few attempts at baking, I would pick store mixes. And this one time, I wanted to be fancy, I bought sprinkles and whipped cream. I baked my cake, decorated it with whipped cream and the sprinkles. It was so good omg, now that's my signature cake that everyone be asking for. One disclaimer though, you may have to adjust the following ingredients down bellow becuase I don't do measurements. I do whatever my heart wants me to do (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧</p>

    <h2>Tips from the expert(me)</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Use Room Termperature Ingredients: Do NOT put any of them in the microwave, I'm so serious when I say this. Your egg, butter, and buttermilk. Everything would workout better if it's in the room temperature.</li>
      <li>Check for Doneness: Just 5 minutes before its due time, get it out and insert a toothpick into the center of one. If it comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs. Don't overbake, it's gonna be dry and flakey.</li>
      <li>Don't Overmix the Batter: If you like dense and tough muffins, well sure do it. However, if you don't, stir the wet and dry ingredients until it's just combined. It is OKAY if there are a few lumps.</li>
    </ol>
