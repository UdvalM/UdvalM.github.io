# My form  
I used email and number types for the first two. And for everything else I made it a checkbox because I'm assuming that some people may want more than one entrees for different reasons and for everything else it looked appropriate to assume so too. 

# The development process  
The process went okay, it was little annoying to be pulling everytime I did anything and to see what changes the others have made you wouldn't notice it unless you have already committed it. That was the only annoying part but everything else it was okay.
