    <h1>How to make scumptious blueberry muffins</h1>
    <a href="#instructions">Jump to the tutorial</a>
    <p>Every Sunday morning, the kitchen would fill with the sweet aroma of homemade blueberry muffins, a recipe passed down through generations. As a little girl, the tradition was to sneak bites of the warm muffins as they cooled, always caught but never scolded. Years later, with children of her own, the tradition continued, with little hands helping to pick fresh blueberries from the backyard. When the time came that the family matriarch could no longer bake, the next generation learned the recipe, ensuring that the beloved Sunday ritual would live on, always with a pinch of love and patience. Love you Grandma. She used to say "muffins are better friends than some people." as she baked them, I miss her o(╥﹏╥)o.</p>

    <h2>Tips from the expert(me)</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Toss Blueberries in Flour: before adding them to the batter, toss them in a tablespoon of flour. This helps prevent the berries from sinking to the bottom of the bottom of the muffin and distrubtes them more evely throughout.</li>
      <li>Use Room Termperature Ingredients: Do NOT put any of them in the microwave, I'm so serious when I say this. Your egg, butter, and buttermilk. Everything would workout better if it's in the room temperature.</li>
      <li>Check for Doneness: Just 5 minutes before its due time, get it out and insert a toothpick into the center of one. If it comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs. Don't overbake, it's gonna be dry and flakey.</li>
      <li>Do Not Thaw the Berries: If you let them thaw, the berries will make the batter blue. If using frozen berries, reduce the mixing time a little to avoid too much color transfer. Well if you like the blue color then go ahead, but remember not to overmix.</li>
      <li>Don't Overmix the Batter: If you like dense and tough muffins, well sure do it. However, if you don't, stir the wet and dry ingredients until it's just combined. It is OKAY if there are a few lumps.</li>
