    <p>This is my second year learning about computers, I know python and currently learning c++ right now. I took web design and development because my computer programming class did html for a month or two and I loved it. However I was having issues with putting pictures onto my page, and by taking this class now I am hoping to get a little more advanced with my pages.</p>
