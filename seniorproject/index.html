   <h1>Who am I?</h1>
   <p>My name is Udval and I'm a senior at Wakefield Highschool. I just made my decision to go to New York Institute of Technology majoring in mechanical engineering. I read a lot of graphical novels and I am interested in interactive and holographical technology.</p>
   <h1>Why are we here?</h1>
   <p>Ever since I was young, I was always captivated by how fast my home city Ulaanbaatar would change. As I grew up, I was introduced to different types of technology, I went from watching Micheal Jackson's music video on CD with small boxy TV to watching it on 32" Television that let's you navigate through youtube. While I was met with new technology, I was also getting bombarded with how different Mongolia was in each period of time. I would hear my grandparents discussing about how they would they'd travel to the city and it would be two or three tall buildings and how captivated they were to see them. On the other side of the room I would hear my parents sharing photos from their teenage years commenting about how they build the noodle factory with me and my younger brother talking about how our school's smartboards have really bad quality.</p>
   <p>These different conversations that was happening simulateously in the same room inspired me to create this project. In this project I will take you along </p>
