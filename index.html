       <h1>About me!</h1>
       <p>Little about the first picture on top; I am in a alternative band as a morin khuurist(the instrument i have in the photo), 
        guitarist and lowkey a singer. I met these guys through the only other girl in the picture 2024 October. We have been rehearsing
        and experimenting with genres. The girl in the photo has a song out now!! Perfect Blue by Reniiv(little promo)</p>

       <p>Ever since I was young as 12, I started learning music. I have been playing the fiddle for almost a decade now.
        The guitar for two years. Music has been such a big part of my life, it's part of me now :D</p>
       <p>The one in the middle is me, I am going to graduate from Wakefield High School this year! I have made the big decision already
        as well :3 I have planned to go to NewYork Institute of Technology as my universiy majoring in electrical and computer engineering.</p>
       <p>Lastly, the context of the picture on the right! I love crafting, I do a lot of crafting on my spare time. This picture was taken 
        when I was working on my moon phases wall decoration project. Embroidery, knitting, crocheting, drawing, cross-stitching, origami,
        sewing, wood carving, and literally everything else you can thnk of, I do it :P </p>
